  ## Installation
  
  To use this app, you must have a source-code editor with inquirer, ascii-art, console.table, and mysql2 installed as dependencies. Once that is done, you simply include your mysql password, database title, and username in the connection.js file. Then in the terminal run "node index.js" and the app will start.
  
  ## Usage
  
  The user goes through the options dependent on what they want to to do. If the user wants to see any of the information in their database, they simply select the option that enables them to see what they want to see. If they want to add or update information, they must choose that selection and answer the questions given in the promp. The user can then see the updated information in the tables whenever they so choose.
